## Getting started

### Requirements

node.js >= 10.13 is required. Make sure you have a compatible version running `node -v` command in your terminal.

If you have to install node, you might be interested in using _nvm_ to install and switch easily between any node version.

### Installation

**1. generate starter code**

```bash
$ npx gatsby new fireblog https://github.com/fireblogcms/gatsby-starter-fireblog
$ cd fireblog
```

**2. Create a `.env` file and fill all required variables from `.env.template` file.**

You can now run dev server:

```bash
$ npm run develop
```

Or build the production files:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Serve your final static locally

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

**3. ðŸ’« Deploy**

After build, your blog is ready inside the "public" directory !

To deploy static sites, we love to use Netlify at fireblogcms.com because it is super easy to use and comes with great addons to makes your JAMstack sites more spicy (lambdas function, forms etc).

## Customize theme for your brand

- Put your own logo to `static/images/logo.png`
- Customize variables from `src/scss/_variables.scss` file.
- Customize css theme by editing `src/scss/_theme.scss`
- Configure top menu links, Progressive Web App name, and more by editing `./gatsby-config.js` file.
