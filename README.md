  Work in progress - Firefly :a Fireblog & Gatsby's blog starter with AMP & PWA support.
</h1>

## What's is this ?

This is a Gatsby's blog start which is forked from [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and here [here](https://github.com/tomoyukikashiro/gatsby-starter-blog-amp-to-pwa)

## AMP to PWA

This starter has AMP to PWA Strategy (a.k.a. AMP as entry point into your PWA). Please check [original blog](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/integration/pwa-amp#amp-as-entry-point-into-your-pwa) for more detail.

## Getting started

node >= 10.13 is required.

> I recommend using "nvm" if you need to install node : https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md
> It allows you to install and use the node version of your choice.

```bash
$ npx gatsby new fireblog https://github.com/fireblogcms/gatbsy-starter-fireblog-firefly
$ cd fireblog
```

Now create a `.env` file and fill the variables from `.env.template` file.

To develop locally:

```bash
$ yarn develop
```

To build and serve the production files:

```bash
$ yarn run build && yarn run serve
```
