## Getting started

### Requirements

node.js >= 10.13 is required. Make sure you have a compatible version running `node -v` command in your terminal.

If you have to install node, you might be interested in using `nvm` to install and switch easily between any node version.

### Installation

Generate starter code

```sh
npx gatsby new fireblog https://github.com/fireblogcms/gatsby-starter-fireblog
cd fireblog
```

Create a `.env` file copied from the `.env.template` file and set your environment variables

```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

You can now run dev server

```sh
npm run develop
```

Or build the production files

```sh
npm run build
```

Serve your final static locally

```bash
npm run serve
```

ðŸ’« Deploy

After the build, your blog is ready inside the `public` directory!

To deploy static sites, we love to use Netlify at fireblogcms.com because it is super easy to use and comes with great addons to makes your JAMstack sites spicier (lambdas functions, forms etc).

## Customize theme for your brand

- Put your own logo to `static/images/logo.png`
- Customize variables from `src/scss/_variables.scss` file
- Customize css theme by editing `src/scss/_theme.scss`
- Configure top menu links, Progressive Web App name, and more by editing `./gatsby-config.js` file
